alongside Larry Grayson for four years, has blasted the efforts of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mel and Sue </a>, as it returned on Sunday night.</p><p>In an exclusive chat, she branded it “disappointingly lacklustre” and said it lacked innovation.</p><p>Isla, said: “The staging seemed rather cramped.</p><p>“Mel and Sue’s presentation style, although competent and ­pleasant, didn’t have the drive and sparkle of previous hosts.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000001514029.jpg>Isla St Clair, who co-hosted the show with Larry Grayson, said the new stage looked 'cramped'<span>“The contestants, as ever, were fine indeed and came up with some of the funniest lines.</span></p><p>“I was surprised that the producers plumped for the old format with little new innovation, encompassing perhaps a computer-style game which would invariably flummox the oldies and amuse the younger generation.</p><p>All in all, a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">degeneration game</a> show.”</p><p>On Monday, I told how the programme — which has also been fronted by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bruce Forsyth</a> and Jim Davidson — had suffered a conveyor belt of gaffes as it recycled old gags, used canned laughter and lost its first choice host in Miranda Hart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict0003950602622.jpg><p>Former co-host Isla initially had high hopes and asked why it had taken this long for the reboot to take place.<br>She said: “I don’t know what’s taken the BBC so long to revive such a fun family format, enjoyed by all ages.</p><p>“People are longing for something good fun that doesn’t involve eating worms or awful revelations about folks’ dirty washing which should’ve been kept indoors.”</p><p>The show was meant to be a four-part series but bosses axed half after being left unimpressed with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mel and Sue’s gags</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

above with Teddy and husband Charlie Thomson, said: “I was trying to express between meetings and my breast milk was kept in the fridge with food and drink for the show’s guests.</p><p>“Then I’d be

was also “anxious and a bit sick” about being replaced when she went on maternity leave last year.</p><p>She told the Happy Mum Happy Baby podcast: “I was worried that somebody else would do it better.</p><p>“I was hitting my career stride and then biology was dictating when I needed to take a break.</p><p>I’m the main breadwinner, so that raised a lot of
