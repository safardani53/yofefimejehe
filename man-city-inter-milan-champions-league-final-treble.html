No matter how intense the opposition press is, City normally find a way to get the ball to their attacking players further up the pitch.</p><p>The signing of <a href=#>Erling Haaland</a> gave Guardiola’s men the option to play over the press rather than through it.</p><p>The Norwegian goal machine excels in the air and can bully even the toughest defenders.</p><p>The worry for Inter will be committing too many bodies in the press and leaving fewer at the back to deal with the long balls from Ederson to Haaland. Arsenal know all about this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Inter-Milan-vs-Man-City-Preview-2.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/the-sun-22-23-heat-map-cutout-073488f5-ba34-4eb5-a6ba-8b41f5bdba2f.png><p>It is perhaps a wiser idea for Inzaghi to instruct his players to drop off into a narrow defensive block, not engaging higher up the pitch where they can be carved open with ease.</p><h2><strong>City can’t concede first</strong></h2><p>The semi-finals of the <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Champions League</a> drew up a mouth-watering Derby della Madonnina between Inter and city rivals AC Milan.</p><p>It was the first time since 2005 that the duo had faced one another in the UCL knockout phase. However, within eleven minutes, the tie was dead and buried.</p><p>Edin Dzeko’s eighth-minute opener was followed by a goal from Henrikh Mkhitaryan in the eleventh minute to ultimately seal the victory for the three-time winners of the tournament.</p><p>But it was not Inter scoring twice in the first leg that killed the game, it was because the goals came so early, allowing Inzaghi to change his approach with almost 170 minutes left in the tie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Inter-Milan-vs-Man-City-Preview-3.png><p>This goal prompted a prominent change to the Nerazzurri’s approach in the game.</p><p>They no longer needed to pile bodies forward to score and so did the very opposite.</p><p>Instead of instructing the wingbacks to advance forward in and out of possession, the head coach ensured that his team dropped off into a compact defensive shape.</p><p>There was no longer a need to take risks and so <a href=#>Inter</a> didn’t.</p><p>Internazionale’s possession statistics dropped drastically too. In the first fifteen minutes of the game, Inzaghi’s men averaged 56 percent of the ball.</p><p>In the 15 minutes following this, that number fell to 29 percent.</p><p>In fact, for the rest of the game, Inter’s possession percentage never climbed above 48 percent.</p><p>This continued throughout the second leg as Inter registered 42 percent of the ball against Milan in the ‘home’ fixture.</p><p>The Italian giants dropped off into a 5-3-2 low block to protect the goal for as long as possible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Inter-Milan-vs-Man-City-Preview-4.png><p>Inzaghi’s strategy worked. Milan created an xG of just 1.2 in total across both legs as Inter held onto a clean sheet for the entirety of the tie.</p><p>It was a defensive masterclass from Inter and a virtuosic tactical performance from the 47-year-old manager.</p><p>The Italian side are incredibly difficult to break down when they drop off into a low defensive block.</p><p>Manchester City will want to avoid conceding an early goal so to not suffer the same fate as AC Milan.</p><h2><strong>Stopping City’s wide attacks</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Man City’s 4-0 thrashing of Real Madrid</a> in the semi-final second leg last month was arguably one of the most dominant Champions League performances of all-time given the context of Los Blancos being European champions.</p><p>From minute one to the referee’s final whistle, the Mancunian side asserted sheer dominance on the field.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/the-sun-22-23-touch-map-cutout-6c216fe4-5e0c-4294-ad98-8a11fc323383.png><p>If the game was a boxing match, it would have been stopped after the first round.</p><p>The defending champions hardly laid a glove on Guardiola’s hungry pack of wolves.</p><p>One of the biggest mistakes Carlo Ancelotti made was deploying a front three with little to no defensive responsibilities.</p><p>Karim Benzema, Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo stayed higher up the pitch while the midfield trio and the back four tried to stop the waves of Man City attacks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Inter-Milan-vs-Man-City-Preview-5.png><p>Defending with a block of seven against one of the most potent attacking sides in Europe seems like a grave error and in hindsight, it was.</p><p>Nevertheless, Inter’s defensive structure will be far better suited to dealing with the wide triangles of City’s wingers, central midfielders and fullbacks than Real Madrid were.</p><p>Given that the Nerazzurri defend in a 5-3-2 low block, they will have an extra man already and can potentially have a 4v3 overload against this triangle using the nearest wingback, wide centre-back, central midfielder and pivot player.</p><p>Even one of Inter’s two centre-forwards can drop back to cover certain central passing lanes too if necessary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Inter-Milan-vs-Man-City-Preview-6.png><p>It will require a lot of hard work but the Serie A giants can stop these wide attacks from the English champions with cooperation, communication and tactical intelligence.</p><p>Arguably the most important attacking arsenal that Inter will need to watch out for is channel runs from the central midfielders.</p><p>Gündoğan in particular is excellent at making these little moves between the fullback and the centre-back to receive a through ball in behind, setting him up for a cut-back cross.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ebx_image.jpg><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=#>CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL -
