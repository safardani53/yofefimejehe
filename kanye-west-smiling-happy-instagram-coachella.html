My family including my cousin Kanye surprised my grandma for her 85th bday.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="more on kanye west">more on kanye west</h2><p>"Been too long since... was a great day."</p><p>In the clip Kanye's elderly relative is caught off guard as her family arrives to celebrate her birthday.</p><p>The 44-year-old rapper is then seen with a big smile on his face as he hugs her before the family sing along to Isn't She Lovely by Stevie Wonder.</p><p>Another family member wrote on social media: "Best surprise ever all she wanted was all her family together & we got her good. When she start crying she had me crying like a punk b****."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>A source told The Sun the lucky birthday girl was Jean Roberson, who is referred to in Kanye's songs as 'Aunt Jean'.</p><p>Fans were quick to take to the comments section to react to Kanye being surrounded by love.</p><p>One wrote: "This is awesome brotha! Family over everything. Probably the most I've ever seen Kanye smile."</p><p>Another added: "This is what Kanye needs, man! Beautiful family," while a third chimed in, "This is so pure... blessings to grandma on her birthday."</p><p>Kanye rocked up to the party alone but he spent the earlier part of the weekend in Montecito laying low with new love <a href=#>Chaney Jones</a>, according to insiders.</p><p>The model, 24, who has been dating Ye casually for the past few months, even showed off a new Birkin bag on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> after a romantic dinner at Stonehouse at San Ysidro Ranch with the star, first reported by the Deuxmoi Instagram account.</p><p>She captioned the snap, which also featured a box of silver roses, with the words: "Thanks bb," and tagged her rapper beau.</p><p>An eyewitness told The Sun: "It was Friday around 8.30pm, it was just the two of them and they stayed for about 45 minutes.</p><h2 id=coachella-dropout><strong>COACHELLA DROPOUT</strong></h2><p>"They seemed to be in good spirits and kind to the staff. I'm not sure if they had a meal, I think it was just small plates."</p><p>A second insider revealed: "Kanye has gone underground at the moment, and his team is barely talking to anyone.</p><p>"He's trying to stay out of the spotlight for a while and surround himself with the right people."</p><p>Collaborator Sean Leon, who worked on DONDA 2, also posted on Monday: "Vision too big for Coachella or any other festivals/award shows. OG building his own thing."</p><p>Sources have told The Sun rumors amid the Coachella crowd are that he will be replaced by The Weeknd or Migos.</p><p>While fans have been left disappointed Kanye has dropped out, it's unlikely they will get ticket refunds after forking out hundreds of dollars on passes and travel.</p><p>A separate source said: "There is fine print regarding line-up changes, and the festival has insurance," adding: "After the past few weeks with Kanye this didn't come as a huge shock."</p><h2 id=moving-forward><strong>MOVING FORWARD</strong></h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>, Kanye has decided not to perform after previously threatening to pull out following a post by fellow headliner Billie Eilish, which he felt dissed Travis Scott.</p><p>Kylie Jenner's baby daddy has <a href=#>not performed live</a> since the <a href=#>Astroworld tragedy</a>, which claimed the lives of 10 people and left hundreds injured, and had been invited to take to the stage with Ye.</p><p>Kanye demanded on Instagram: "Come on Billie we love you. Please apologize to Trav and to the families of the people who lost their lives. No one intended this to happen.</p><p>"Trav didn't have any idea of what was happening when he was on stage and was very hurt by what happened, and yes Trav will be with me at Coachella but now I need Billie to apologize before I perform."</p><p>Billie refused to apologize and simply wrote in the comments: "Literally never said a thing about Travis.
