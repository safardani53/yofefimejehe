However, a lot of people desperately want to see Corso retire.</p><p>It might be because of concern towards the old man’s health or hunger to see a new face lightening the show.</p><p>Everyone was well aware of the Covid-19 pandemic, and ESPN made a wise decision. They chose to keep Corso at home because of his age and possible health threats.</p><p>He joined the team after the pandemic was over and is continuously doing his job as a football analyst.</p><h2>Lee Corso | On Spotlight</h2><p>Corso was spotted saying, “Ah F**k it,” in an episode of College GameDay.
