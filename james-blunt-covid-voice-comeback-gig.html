And two of the crew.</p><p>“And they were double jabbed and they got over it really well.</p><p>“I was only single jabbed and I thought I was going to be fine but actually it got into my lungs and I don’t know if you can hear, but my speaking voice is f***ed.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>‘My really small willy is even smaller’</h2><p>“Now I am on steroids and they have made my really small willy smaller. I mean, even smaller.</p><p>“I haven’t got a big guy anyway and when the doctor said, ‘Do you want to go on steroids?’, I was like, ‘F**k no!’.”</p><p>James could barely speak while on stage but managed to croak out his remarks to entertain the crowds who had packed in for the show.</p><p>Sadly though, he was coughing throughout and had to stick to drinking water, so he couldn’t join in the knees-up the post-Freedom Day crowd were having.</p><p>Given James is musical Marmite, some of you cruel lot out there may be rejoicing about the prospect of not hearing him sing any more. However, he has had the last laugh there.</p><p>He is still hopeful that he will be able to tour the UK as planned next year, as it is his speaking voice which has been affected more than his vocals.</p><p>He said: “Covid has got me — my speaking voice is f***ed.</p><p>“The Chinese are clever buggers, aren’t they? But I can still sing. So they did that wrong, didn’t they?”</p><p>Whether his voice is back to its best or not, he can probably write off a tour of China after that comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000667822148.jpg><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Jo hits the club</h2><p>JO O’MEARA is making sure she will be remembered as the voice of S Club 7 by re-recording the group’s best hits for a solo record.</p><p>The singer, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who had lead vocals on the majority of the band’s Noughties tunes</a>, is planning to put out the collection later this year following the release of her first solo album in more than a decade next month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/39515d74-cd0a-4831-b3f9-74e251f8cca0.jpg><p>She recently recorded an acoustic cover of their third No1 single Don’t Stop Movin’ and is now planning more.</p><p>In an exclusive chat, Jo said: “I have now decided I’m going back in the studio to do a full album of the S Club 7 classics.</p><p>“I’m going to pick a couple of the songs I love the most from all the albums and I’m going to make an album of acoustic S Club songs.</p><p>“After the success of Don’t Stop Movin’ I had a lot of fans reaching out and saying, ‘Can you do Have You Ever’ or ‘Can you do this song’.</p><p>“I thought, ‘Do you know what, the fans have been so supportive of S Club 7 and of me, it would be a lovely way to say thank you so much’.”</p><p>Jo will release With Love, her solo album, on August 27.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Strum look, Meg</h2><p>MEGAN THEE STALLION must have been feeling a little plucky when she went out in this dress.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The WAP rapper</a> held a guitar at a party to celebrate Sports Illustrated magazine’s 2021 swimsuit issue, for which she was the cover girl.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000668013426.jpg><p>She proved she had the credentials for the job by leaving little to the imagination with her outfit at the bash in Florida on Friday.</p><p>Lucky there was no breeze, or she would have been prone to a major wardrobe malfunction.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Liam's puppy love</h2><p>IF LIAM PAYNE’s shredded body doesn’t help him attract some interest after his engagement broke off, his new puppy will.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sharing a topless photo with the new pooch nearby</a>, the One Direction star wrote: “When your puppy decides to jump into your progress pic.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000668015670-1.jpg><p>Speaking last month about life in lockdown, Liam said: “Everybody struggled the most without routine.
