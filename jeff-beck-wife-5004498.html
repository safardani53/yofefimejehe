Not only was Jeff respected as an individual guitarist, but he also performed alongside many <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>famous musicians</a> throughout his decades-long career. Prior to his Jan. 10, 2023, passing, Jeff released his most recent track “This Is A Song For Miss Hedy Lamarr” alongside actor&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Johnny Depp</strong></a>. Aside from his musical talent, Jeff was a devoted husband to his wife,&nbsp;<strong>Sandra Cash</strong>. Below is everything to know about Jeff and Sandra’s marriage, along with details on his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first wife</a>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jeff-beck-marriages-embed1.jpg><h2>Jeff Beck’s Wife Sandra Cash</h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>Jeff <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was married</a> to Sandra Cash, 58, from 2005 until the singer’s death in 2023. Although Jeff kept much of his personal life private, it is known that the duo met when he was 60 years old and Sandra was 40, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun</a>. Sandra does not work in entertainment like her late husband and she also keeps out of the public eye.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>When the couple married 18 years ago, they were surrounded by many family and friends. Notable people like singer&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sir Paul</strong> <strong>McCartney</strong></a>, 80, were in attendance, according to the outlet above. Sandra and Jeff lived a quite life away from cameras in Wadhurst,&nbsp;East Sussex, and did not welcome any kids together.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Despite not being in the limelight with their marriage, Jeff’s collaborator and&nbsp;Pirates of the Caribbean star Johnny Depp spoke about the late rock n’ roller and his wife during a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Nov. 2022 interview</a>. “There’s a couple who very much helped to keep me alive and sane and happy through the weirdness… and that’s Jeff and Sandra,” he said at the time.</p><h2>His First Marriage To Patricia Brown</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jeff-beck-marriages-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Prior to his marriage to Sandra, the Grammy-winner was married to&nbsp;<strong>Patricia Brown</strong>. The former couple was married from 1963 until they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>called it quits</a> in 1967. Patricia was not a public figure and not much is known about her or their marriage. They did, however, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>get married</a> when Jeff was young, as he was only 19 years old. By the time they got divorced the musician was 23 years old and already paving his way into a successful career. Jeff and Patricia did not welcome any children together either.</p><h2>Jeff’s Death</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>The six stringed Warrior is no longer here for us to admire the spell he could weave around our mortal emotions. Jeff could channel music from the ethereal.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>— Jimmy Page (@JimmyPage) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>January 11, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>On Jan. 11, 2023, Jeff’s family announced <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>via Instagram</a> that the iconic rocker <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>had died</a>. “On behalf of his family, it is with deep and profound sadness that we share the news of Jeff Beck’s passing,” the caption of the post read. “After suddenly contracting bacterial meningitis, he peacefully passed away yesterday. His family ask for privacy while they process this tremendous loss.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Soon many celebrities took to social media to react to Jeff’s death, like English musician&nbsp;<strong>Jimmy Page</strong>, who <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a>, “His technique unique. His imaginations apparently limitless. Jeff I will miss you along with your millions of fans. Jeff Beck Rest in Peace.” Later, “Crazy Train” hitmaker&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ozzy Osbourne</a>&nbsp;</strong>mourned his colleague via <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a>. “I can’t express how saddened I am to hear of @JeffBeckMusic ’s passing. What a terrible loss for his family, friends & his many fans. It was such an honor to have known Jeff & an incredible honor to have had him play on my most recent album, #PatientNumber9. Long live #JeffBeck.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Finally, “Some Guys Have All The Luck” rock n’ roll legend&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rod Stewart</strong></a> also took to the social media platform to pay tribute to Jeff. “Jeff Beck was on another planet . He took me and <strong>Ronnie Wood</strong> to the USA in the late 60s in his band the Jeff Beck Group and we haven’t looked back since,” he posted alongside <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a snapshot</a> with Jeff. “He was one of the few guitarists that when playing live would actually listen to me sing and respond . Jeff, you were the greatest, my man . Thank you for everything . RIP.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8menZ9lkpqwrHnWop2eZWVlfXWAmHFm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjeff-beck-wife-5004498.html&text=Everything%20To%20Know%20About%20His%202%20Marriages%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeff-beck-wife-5004498.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeff-beck-wife-5004498.html&title=Everything%20To%20Know%20About%20His%202%20Marriages%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjeff-beck-wife-5004498.html&title=Everything%20To%20Know%20About%20His%202%20Marriages%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjeff-beck-wife-5004498.html&title=Everything%20To%20Know%20About%20His%202%20Marriages%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeff-beck-wife-5004498.html&description=Everything%20To%20Know%20About%20His%202%20Marriages%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-old-are-tammy-and-amy-slaton.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Old Are Tammy and Amy Slaton on '1000-lb Sisters'?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./celebs-hair-makeovers-2019-met-gala.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celebs Hair Makeovers At 2019 Met Gala  Pics  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
