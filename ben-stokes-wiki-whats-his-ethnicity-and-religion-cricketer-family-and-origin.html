He is an English cricketer who is now the batter for the Chennai Superkings in the IPL (Indian Premier League). He is presently the captain of the English test squad and plays for the England national teams in ODIs and Twenty20 matches.</p><p>Ben is well-known for his extraordinary cricketing ability, and his contemporaries and admirers sometimes refer to him as “OBE.” He is a left-handed batsman for England Cricket.&nbsp;Stokes has established himself as one of England’s most prized assets over the last three years. He has represented England in all three forms of cricket.</p><h2>Ben Stokes Religion: Is He a Christian? Ethnicity And Origin Of The Family</h2><p><strong>Ben Stokes</strong> was born on June 4, 1991, to a Christian household. Deborah Stokes is his mother, and Gerard Stokes, a former rugby league player, is his father. Ben’s parents have been a source of encouragement for him to pursue athletics as a profession. Similarly, Ben Stokes’ religious beliefs have been heavily affected by his parents. Ben Stokes has been a Christian from infancy, following in the footsteps of his parents. The family is of white English heritage.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ben-Stokes-2.jpg alt="Ben Stokes" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The couple gave birth and reared the player in New Zealand for a brief time. When Ben was 12, they went to England with their children. Ben has two brothers, Tom and Sam Curran, who are both supportive of his work.&nbsp;Ratcliffe and Ben Stokes were engaged in 2013, and Stokes and Clare married in East Brent, Somerset, in October 2017. Their two children, Layton and Libby, were born.</p><h2>Ben Stokes Career</h2><p>In 2009, Ben Stokes earned his first call to the Durham of his own nation. He took a wicket after the third pitch at The Oval, where he was making his debut.&nbsp;He played in a test match against the Bangladesh Under-19 team. Throughout the series, he displayed his all-around ability and helped his side win. Following that, Ben Stokes played for England’s Under 19 World Cup squad in 2010, when he struck a century against India.</p><p>Stokes made his Durham debut the following year at Abu Dhabi. He scored a century and a half in his debut. In 2010, he made his county debut against Essex.&nbsp;Similarly, in May 2010, he scored his first century in a first-class game. Stokes joined Durham on a full-time basis in all forms within a year. He had a fantastic debut season.&nbsp;Ben Stokes was part of Durham’s County Championship-winning side in 2013. Furthermore, Stokes was engaged by Northern Superchargers for The Hundred in 2022.</p><h2>Ben Stokes’ Career in the Indian Premier League</h2><p>Rising Pune Supergiants signed Ben Stokes for the 2017 IPL season. His 316 runs, including a century and a half, came in 12 games. When he was purchased by the Rajasthan Royals in 2018, he was the season’s most expensive player. However, the season was not a success for him.&nbsp;In 2020, Ben Stokes scored his second IPL century. The following year, he was forced to withdraw from the tournament after suffering an injury in the opening game of the Rajasthan Royals’ season. Stokes withdrew from the TATA IPL 2022 to dedicate more attention to his national team and to address a knee injury for which he had a cortisone shot.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ben-Stokes-1.jpg alt="Ben Stokes" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Ben Stokes, England’s Test captain, will only be available to Chennai Super Kings as a specialist batter in the first round of the Indian Premier League in 2023.&nbsp;The legendary allrounder arrived in India last week to prepare for the next season, which begins on March 31.
