During his college days, John actively participated in basketball matches.</p><p>Likewise, he also acted as a substitute for injured players and suspended players. Such players are called taxi-squad.</p><p>However, Starks was expelled from his team as he used to hide his fellow player’s equipment in retaliation for the other player breaking into his dorm room.</p><p>After Stark was expelled in 1985, he was transferred to Northern Oklahoma College. He stayed in jail for 5 days for that previous robbery case.</p><p>Starks was doing great, but he left the college after being caught smoking cannabis.</p><p>Further, Starks got transferred to Tulsa Junior School to get a degree in business.</p><p>While in school, he used to play for the school team, and one day while he was playing, Ken Trickey (former coach of Oral Robert Universi) noticed him.</p><p>Besides, Starks was at Tulsa Junior only for a season. Later, Starks got a scholarship to Oklahoma State University, and he decided to complete his education from there.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Starks was very naughty as a teenager; he had to change many schools due to his behavior.
