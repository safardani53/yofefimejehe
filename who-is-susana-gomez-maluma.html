They've made more frequent appearances together in the years since, from romantic date nights around the world to family vacations.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While neither has spoken publicly about their romance, the pop star — whose real name is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Juan Luis Londoño Arias</a> — has been open about longing for a love like this. His <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>2020 single "ADMV,"</a> which stands for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Amor De Mi Vida</a> (Love of My Life), talked about how he wanted <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>a life partner</a>, and he opened up about the meaning in an interview with PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That song I wrote because I <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>want that in my life</a>," he said of the single, which is about a couple growing old together. "That's a song that I could say, 'Yeah, I want to get old and have a family.' … That's one of my biggest dreams — getting old with someone next to me and giving my life to someone."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, who is Maluma's girlfriend? Here's everything to know about Susana Gomez and her relationship with the singer.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-is-an-architect-interior-designer-and-jewelry-designer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She is an architect, interior designer and jewelry designer</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Maluma's leading lady is a true creative. She's built a name for herself as an architect and interior designer in Colombia. In February 2023, Gomez added a jewelry designer to her resume with the launch of Sileo Timeless Jewelry, a company she started with her sister Juliana Gomez. Maluma was there to support her at the release event.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-maluma-are-both-proud-colombians></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She and Maluma are both proud Colombians</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Alexander Tamargo/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Maluma and Gomez are both from Medellin, Colombia, and take great pride in their country.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When people talk about Colombia, they don't talk about Pablo Escobar anymore or drugs or violence," Maluma told PEOPLE about his home in April 2021. "When they come to Latin America, they feel like we have an amazing culture. They say that we're good people, that we are people who love helping. It makes me <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>feel pretty proud</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gomez also shines a light on the amazing natural resources of the area — something she takes advantage of with her jewelry line. "[We make] handcrafted pieces made in Medellin, Colombia using precious stones such as diamonds, Colombian emeralds, rubies, or other kinds of semiprecious stones," her brand shared on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the couple travels a lot, they still spend much time in Colombia together and with their families.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I want to go back to Medellín, I want to go back to my farm, be there with my family, with my friends, with my animals," Maluma <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Rolling Stone</a> in August 2022. "That's what inspires me right now. Just what I am. I don't have to go and look for something that I already have inside."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-maluma-seemingly-went-instagram-official-in-december-2021></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She and Maluma seemingly went Instagram official in December 2021</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Maluma made waves in December 2021 when he posted a blurry photo of passionately kissing a woman, assumed to be Gomez, in front of his family's Christmas tree. "Gracias, Santa," he wrote alongside the now-deleted picture.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The photo marked the first time Maluma posted a romantic partner on his feed since splitting from his ex, model and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>DJ Natalia Barulich</a>, in October 2019.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-seems-to-be-close-with-malumas-family></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She seems to be close with Maluma's family</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mar Arias Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gomez seems to have been welcomed into Maluma's family with open arms. She's made several appearances on his mom Marlli Arias' Instagram page, including some from their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>family holiday trip</a> in December 2022, which shows the family and Gomez wearing matching cowboy hats one night and all dressed in white another.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Arias also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>posted photos</a> from the launch event for Gomez's Sileo Timeless Jewelry collection, which shows her beaming with pride and her arms around Gomez and her sister. In response to the photo, Gomez left her some love in the form of a comment: "Mar ❤️❤️❤️."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both the singer's sister, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Manuela Londoño</a>, and manager, Clara Pablo, also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>post photos</a> with Gomez often, many of which feature her in cozy poses with Maluma.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-fans-speculate-malumas-song-junio-was-inspired-by-her></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Fans speculate Maluma's song "Junio" was inspired by her</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Maluma released his single "Junio" in September 2022, and fans quickly began guessing it was a love letter to Gomez. The romantic ballad has lyrics like "You give me heat as if it was summer in June/How cool would it be if you were my girlfriend … Celestial eyes, ocean of the Turks and Caicos/With you, I don't need the ocean/You are my sun."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I feel like I'm coming back to my roots," he told Rolling Stone in August about the song. "When I went out from Medellín with my music around the world, I felt like I was losing a little bit of myself … maybe [my songs] were a hit, but I didn't feel like that was my essence. Now I want to be successful, but in a more personal way."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Maluma added fuel to the fire when he sang "Junio" at the 2022 Billboard Latin Music Awards and ended the performance by stepping off the stage to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>give Gomez a kiss</a> in front of the world.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-maluma-have-been-spotted-all-around-the-world-together></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She and Maluma have been spotted all around the world together</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Manuela Londoño Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gomez and Maluma have traveled the world together, both for business and pleasure. In August 2022, the actor's sister posted a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>photo</a> of them all together to support his Contraluz mezcal launch in Oaxaca, Mexico. The couple stepped out for another event for celebrate Maluma's mezcal in West Hollywood, California, that December, per photos obtained by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>JustJared</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair shared a steamy vacation in Spain in July 2022, during which they were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>photographed</a> swimming off a private yacht together in Formentera. They were also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>spotted</a> sightseeing in Greece together in March 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Most recently, Gomez and Maluma appeared at the South Beach Wine and Food Festival Grand Tasting on Feb. 26, 2023, in Miami Beach, Florida, to promote his mezcal brand. They were seen hugging, kissing and cuddling up at the event. Just a few weeks later, Maluma shared some <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>steamy shots of himself shirtless in a pool</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Casi no encuentro fotógrafa 😈," he captioned the photo in Spanish, which roughly translates to: "I almost didn't find a photographer." In the snaps, Maluma shows off his tatted torso while his photographer's hand covers his lower half. Fans were quick to assume that Gomez was behind the sexy photos.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-maluma-nearly-proposed-to-her-in-january-2023></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Maluma nearly proposed to her in January 2023</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Maluma sent fans into chaos in January 2023, when he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sparked engagement rumors</a> on his birthday. The moment happened as he celebrated his 29th in Miami with Gomez and some A-list friends, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Marc Anthony</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>David Beckham</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As soon as his pals were finished singing "Happy Birthday," he asks a friend for a ring and gestured to his left ring finger in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>video</a>. First, he pretends to put it on his cake, then looks over at Gomez, who is covering her face, and winks before giving the ring back to his friend and laughing it off. He gave Gomez a kiss, and then blew out the candles.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-maluma-are-expecting-their-first-child></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She and Maluma are expecting their first child</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In October 2023, the couple announced that they are currently <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>expecting a baby girl</a>, whom they've named Paris. The big news was revealed in Maluma's music video for his single "Procura."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Paris, our beautiful daughter, she’s growing inside her mom’s belly and she gives me many reasons to keep dreaming.
