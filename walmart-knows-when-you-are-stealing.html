It definitely seems like a shoplifter's dream come true.</p><p>Faking out the weight system shouldn't be too difficult, especially if one knows how heavy the items they plan on buying beforehand are. All you'd have to do is get the appropriate poundage down and you'd be able to scan lower-cost items to score a couple of free goodies on your own without arousing suspicion.</p><p>But one Walmart employee revealed how the store goes about stopping would-be thieves.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>@thewalmartguy69 (nice) posted a clip to TikTok that's making the rounds on the popular social media platform with a text overlay that reads: "POV: We know when you're stealing."</p><p>In the clip, the employee shows a nifty little gizmo developed by Zebra Technologies that's designed specifically for retailers to "spy" on customers and survey the items they're bringing to self-checkout.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In the clip</a>, the device can be seen monitoring the items customers scan and if there's anything amiss, it will "register alerts." The scanner is supposed to ascertain whether or not there's any tomfoolery going on and if customers are actually scanning everything they put into their bags at self-checkout.

It was under the cart; I didn’t see it," one user said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Others talked about either forgetting items in their cart or simply forgetting to swipe while at the self-checkout aisle and walking directly out of the store: "I literally walked out with $50+ worth of items on accident because I forgot to swipe my card."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Others were a bit more blatant with the way they shop at Walmart: "I always take one small item as payment for being my own cashier. I don’t work for free."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Then there were users who expressed their befuddlement with the tech: "If y’all know when we’re stealing...why do you guys stare at us like we’re up to something when we’re not?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Even other Walmart employees chimed in stating that they were not paid "enough to care" and that they would simply look the other way if they learned a customer was stealing from the business.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>According to research and analytics, it's in Walmart's best interest to equip its stores with all of the devices that it can to help curb theft from its stores given the huge losses they reportedly incur as a result.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fortune</a>, Walmart states that the corporation loses 1% of potential profits every single year because of theft. With around $300 billion in sales generated in 2015 (the year the article was published) across all of its stores over the world, that's a whopping $3 billion. More recent statistics have placed those figures much higher: in 2020 Walmart generated a reported $523.96 billion in revenue, meaning they gave up over $5 billion in potential earnings due to theft.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Since 2015, Walmart's been actively working on mitigating its losses. Active human monitoring from its loss prevention departments can only go so far, however, which is probably why its implementing the use of technology from companies such as Zebra.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>As far as losing sales due to theft, a 1% loss estimation is a rather conservative figure. Businesses can expect to lose up to 3% of profits a year due to in-store thievery.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Forbes also reported on the economics of how much Walmart should spend every single year in attempting to stop thieves. In the 2016, a local police officer stated that the retailer could definitely be doing more to minimize the amount of thefts that occur in their store, even intimating that a big chunk of his local department's time is spent investigating crimes at a specific Walmart location.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Forbes went on to quote a financial analyst that it may not make sense for the company to invest heavily in as-close-to-total loss prevention: "The cost would be about $3.25 billion a year, or about a quarter of Walmart’s profit last year of $14 billion."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>So the moral of the story is that Walmart's probably only spending as much money as they can before it's just more profitable to let you walk out of the store with those And 1 slippers who've had your eye on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrK6tucCrq2ajnqTEtHnWoZynZamkwm6t0Z5krKyVlrmqusY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwalmart-knows-when-you-are-stealing.html&text=Walmart%20Employee%20Exposes%20Clever%20Way%20They%20Know%20When%20Someones%20Stealing%20at%20Self-Checkout&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwalmart-knows-when-you-are-stealing.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwalmart-knows-when-you-are-stealing.html&title=Walmart%20Employee%20Exposes%20Clever%20Way%20They%20Know%20When%20Someones%20Stealing%20at%20Self-Checkout" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwalmart-knows-when-you-are-stealing.html&title=Walmart%20Employee%20Exposes%20Clever%20Way%20They%20Know%20When%20Someones%20Stealing%20at%20Self-Checkout" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwalmart-knows-when-you-are-stealing.html&title=Walmart%20Employee%20Exposes%20Clever%20Way%20They%20Know%20When%20Someones%20Stealing%20at%20Self-Checkout" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwalmart-knows-when-you-are-stealing.html&description=Walmart%20Employee%20Exposes%20Clever%20Way%20They%20Know%20When%20Someones%20Stealing%20at%20Self-Checkout" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kate-oneill-sister-maddie-obituary-speaks-out.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Woman Who Wrote Obituary for Sister with Drug Addiction Speaks Out">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./miley-cyrus-and-cody-simpson-get-x-rated.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Miley Cyrus and Cody Simpson Get X Rated">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
