She has,&nbsp;however, managed to find love, albeit in an unconventional way. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Kane's finest moments came in the '70s and '80s when&nbsp;her acting skills received massive praises esp. for her series Taxi and movie&nbsp;Hester Street.</p><p>Furthermore, she has continued to make her presence felt with her works in the series American Dreamer in the 90s&nbsp;and more recently Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Carol Kane with&nbsp;Tina Fey, Tituss Burgess, Jane Krakowski,&nbsp;Robert Carlock,&nbsp;and Elle Kemper and other stars during an event for Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt in 2018 (Photo: justjaredjr.com)</p><p>After attending the Professional Children's School, in New York City she got her first taste of acting in theatre in 1966.</p><p>Her TV career started&nbsp;after she appeared in the American comedy series&nbsp;Carnal Knowledge as Jennifer in 1971. Since her debut, she has starred in quite a few television series and movies. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Carol portrayed the character of the evil headmistress, Madame Morrible in the 2005 musical&nbsp;Wicked, which went on&nbsp;until&nbsp;2009.</p><p>Her acting portfolio also includes her performance in theatres, including&nbsp;Love, Loss&nbsp;(2010),&nbsp;The Children's Hour&nbsp;(2011), and&nbsp;&nbsp;Harvey&nbsp;(2012). More recently, she&nbsp;worked in&nbsp;the dark comedy series,&nbsp;The Sisters Brothers, which was set to release in 2018.</p><p>For her role in&nbsp;Taxi, Carol won two Primetime Emmy Awards as a leading and supporting&nbsp;actress in 1982 and 1983, respectively. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>For her role in the 1975 romantic movie,&nbsp;Hester Street she was nominated for the prestigious Academy Awards.</p><h2>Carol Kane's Net Worth Ammassed from Acting</h2><p>Her alluring on-screen performance has won her multiple awards,&nbsp;millions of fans, and millions in financial rewards.</p><p>With the income generated through&nbsp;her acting career in Hollywood over the years, Kane has made quite the fortune for herself.&nbsp;It might come as no surprise that she&nbsp;enjoys an estimated net worth of $5 million. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Carol was born Carolyn Laurie Kane&nbsp;at Elaine Joy in&nbsp;Cleveland, on June 18, 1952.&nbsp;Her Jewish family consisted of an architect father,&nbsp;Michael Myron Kane, and a talented mother who was both a jazz singer and a pianist.</p><p>Her family roots can be traced&nbsp;back to Russia. Her grandparents were Russian immigrants.</p><p><span>Carol Kane's parents separated when she was 12, and the divorce between her parents left her with a sour taste.&nbsp;Being raised by a single mom, she had a void in her life in the absence of her father.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Is Carol Kane Married?</h2><p>Simka Gravas, the on-screen persona embodied by Carol Kane in her acclaimed series Taxi, resembles Carol in some ways.</p><p>Simka is an immigrant; Carol was born into a family of immigrants.</p><p>This is where Carol differs from Simka, though:&nbsp;Simka is an abrasive married woman, who is in constant upheaval with her husband Latka Gravas(Andy Kaufman), whereas&nbsp;Carol is a soft-spoken lady who has never married. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Despite not marrying she did experience a romantic relationship&nbsp;when she was&nbsp;dating actor Woody Harrelson in the mid-1980s.</p><p>In an interview in 1988, Woody confirmed that they had indeed dated. He described his relationship with Carol as a friendship that turned romantic which returned&nbsp;to being just friends.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, Kane's relationship with Woody was the only time that the actress had an affair in the public eye. However, Woody went on to get married two times since he broke up with Kane. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p>Carol Kane and ex-boyfriend&nbsp;Woody in 1980s.
