The 40-year-old went from being a villain character on both <a href=#>Andi Dorfman</a>'s and <a href=#>Kaitlyn Bristowe</a>'s seasons of The Bachelorette to ultimately winning the audience over on Bachelor in Paradise. In a move very few saw coming, Nick got the leading role on Season 21 of the reality series, and he proposed to Vanessa Grimaldi.</p><p>His engagement to Vanessa didn't work out, and he's since been linked to several high-profile stars from the small screen.</p><p><a href=#>Who is Nick Viall dating</a>? He was previously linked to Demi Burnett, Kelley Flanagan, and Rachel Bilson, who are all now in relationships with other people. It looks like things have worked out for the best, though, as Nick has a new fianceé named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Natalie Joy</a>! Here's what we know about her.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Nick Viall started dating Natalie Joy after she slid into his Instagram DMs — and now they're engaged!</h2><p>On Jan. 12, 2023, Nick and his girlfriend of two years, Natalie Joy, revealed they were engaged. The couple took to their respective Instagram accounts to share the news with followers. "For the rest of my life, it's you," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick and Natlie wrote</a> alongside a carousel of engagement photos.</p><p>Both also shared photos from their engagement via Instagram Stories.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In February 2021, Nick mentioned being in a relationship in his podcast, The Viall Files. He said he was "super happy" in his relationship with Natalie (although he didn't reveal her name right away). "It sounds so cheesy, but she does make me want to be better," he said. "Everyone loves her. Without question, everyone likes her more than me. All of my friends."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Rumors of Nick and Natalie's relationship started swirling in 2020, but it wasn't until the following calendar year when they finally confirmed that they're an item. Nick revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a> that the two first met when Natalie slid into his Instagram DMs. "It was playful enough, and I guess it didn't come across as weird?" he said. Apparently, Nick wasn't sure at first whether he should respond. "But thankfully I did," he said. "And it seems to have worked out so far."</p><p>According to her Instagram bio, Natalie is a certified surgical technologist. She works for a private plastic surgery practice in Beverly Hills and is currently living in LA with Nick. At 23, she's also a bit younger than Nick, who is 42 years old.</p><p>In a Q&A sesh in her Instagram Stories, Natalie revealed that she was born and raised in Auburn, Ala., and is the youngest of seven children. She also said that she has never watched any of Nick's Bachelor franchise activities!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Nick was previously linked to Demi Burnett.</h2><p>Though he was linked to <a href=#>Demi Burnett</a> after they attended the 2020 Golden Globe Awards together, Demi soon began posting photos with her beau, Slater Davis.</p><p>Nick also teased a romance with <a href=#>Kelley Flanagan</a> after she was sent home on Peter Weber's season of The Bachelor. Kelley has since confirmed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she and Peter are back together</a>, and that they are exclusively dating.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>So, who has Nick dated in the past? Before rubbing elbows with celebrities, he made a name for himself on the hit ABC dating series after being named the "runner-up" for two seasons.</p><p>Audiences first met the handsome star in 2014 when he appeared on <a href=#>Andi Dorfman</a>'s season of The Bachelorette. After receiving the first impression rose, many thought she'd end up choosing Nick. However, Andi picked Josh Murray and Nick was sent packing in the season finale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Still looking for love, Nick went back on the long-running competition show and fought for <a href=#>Kaitlyn Bristowe</a>'s heart. The two started talking before she became The Bachelorette, and he ruffled the feathers of his co-stars when he became intimate with Kaitlyn well before the Fantasy Suite episode.</p><p>After once again making it to the end, Kaitlyn chose Shawn Booth in the final rose ceremony. Ouch!</p><p>While going 0 for 2 on The Bachelorette might have kept some down, Nick was far from being done with finding love on reality TV.</p><p>Nick then tried his luck on Bachelor in Paradise and initially had set his sights on Amanda Stanton. Well, before Andi's ex Josh swooped in and the two became engaged. That relationship quickly fell apart anyway, but Amanda and Nick never rekindled their romance.</p><p>However, his short-lived fling with Amanda didn't keep his spirit down for long. <a href=#>He started dating Jen Saviano</a> while on BIP, and even shopped for a Neil Diamond ring. When Jen declared her love for Nick, he did not reciprocate her feelings and ended their relationship.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The bombshell decision made for one of the most dramatic moments on the ABC series. After Shawn and Kaitlyn ended their three-year engagement in November 2018, Nick revealed that it was unlikely that the pair would ever reunite. "I don't think so," he said on Heather McDonald's Juicy Scoop podcast when asked if he and Kaitlyn would strike up a romance again.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the past, the exes would throw shade at one another, but the two decided to eventually end their feud. Last May, Kaitlyn talked about their relationship on LadyGang revealing that the two are on good terms.&nbsp;</p><p>"We were doing little, small jabs at each other. And then I was like, 'We just need to talk it out,'" she explained. "And then he was like, 'What did I do [to] you?' I was like, 'Yeah, nothing — that's fair.'"</p><p>In June of 2020, Nick referred to Kaitlyn as a "good friend" in an Instagram caption. He also said that he had only good thoughts about his time on her season of The Bachelorette.&nbsp;</p><p>"TBH I look back on this time of my life and have nothing but positive memories," he wrote in the caption.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Nick's 'Bachelor' ex is in a long term relationship.</h2><p>When he took on the leading role on The Bachelor, Nick proposed to former special education teacher Vanessa Grimaldi. Proving that he wasn't done with ABC quite yet, Nick went on to compete on Season 24 of Dancing with the Stars, and his fiancée cheered him on from the audience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>They ended their engagement in August of 2017, which was one year after the finale aired.
