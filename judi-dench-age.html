Dench?</h2><p><a href=#>Judith Olivia "Judi" Dench</a> was born in Heworth, York on December 9, 1934, which makes her 88 years old.</p><p>Her mum was born in Dublin and her dad was a doctor, who was born in Dorset but later moved to Dublin, where he met Judi’s mother while he was studying at Trinity College.</p><p>Judi went to a Quaker School, The Mount School, in York and was later drawn to the theatre.</p><p>Her family had strong ties with the dramatic arts, with her dad being a GP for York theatre, and her mother working as a wardrobe mistress.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Read More on Judi Dench</h2></p><p>Aspiring actress Judi later trained at the&nbsp;Central School of Speech and Drama and made her first professional stage appearance at the&nbsp;Royal
