Whenever people list off what they’d like in a life partner, many times a “sense of humor” or “funny” is at the top of the list for most desired qualities.</p><p>That’s why it makes so much sense that famous comedians have dated some of the most beautiful Hollywood actors and models. Funny guy <a href=#>David Spade</a> is no exception to that. David was one of the most well-known comedians in the 1990s after he first appeared on Saturday Night Live. David’s successful and lengthy career has helped him to earn a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> estimated at $40 million, but does he have a wife to share his fortune with? <a href=#>Has David ever been married?</a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">David Spade has never been married, but he has dated quite a few ladies.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranker</a>, David has dated an impressive 20 women but has never tied the knot with any of them. The comedian once admitted that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s very hard for him to settle down</a>, but that doesn’t mean he hasn’t thought about it or actually tried.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He told The New York Times, "It's very hard for me, for various reasons, which we won't get into. Too much data, too many gigabytes. But I have been trying to do that. I've known someone for a long time. I've been trying to make something work."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">David Spade’s list of ex-girlfriends is long and blonde.</h2><p>David has dated numerous actors and celebrities, including Heather Locklear, Lara Flynn Boyle, Julie Bowen, Teri Hatcher, and Naya Rivera, just to name a few. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>E! News</u></a> actually called him "a bachelor-era George Clooney of the comedy world” after photos of David and Naya cuddling in a swimming pool went viral.

Their outing caused a lot of speculation and rumors, but nothing was confirmed. A few years later, during the COVID-19 pandemic, he admitted that he was still single.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>That being said, David had another daring confession. "I’m dating someone now,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>. Unfortunately, he didn't really give any additional details, so fans are still left in the dark about if its that serious and who the mystery person is.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">David Spade has a daughter with a Playboy bunny.</h2><p>David shares custody of his daughter with her mother, a former Playboy bunny named Jillian Grace.

And the difference - and why it caused some complications with my own dad — is because he was sort of a ne'er-do-well, which is putting it mildly. I think f--k up is more on the nose.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He continued, “So when I had [Harper], I got this new tidal wave of resentment towards my dad because of his irresponsible behavior and manipulative mean streak. So I stopped talking to him.”</p><p>It’s still a mystery as to if David will settle down with anyone, but he remains a dedicated father and one of the best comedians in his craft. Fans will just have to wait and see.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBusMCvoJ1lo6WupbGMppirqpmasQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-david-spade-married.html&text=David%20Spade%20Wants%20to%20Get%20Married%20%20Is%20He%20Husband%20Material%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-david-spade-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-david-spade-married.html&title=David%20Spade%20Wants%20to%20Get%20Married%20%20Is%20He%20Husband%20Material%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-david-spade-married.html&title=David%20Spade%20Wants%20to%20Get%20Married%20%20Is%20He%20Husband%20Material%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-david-spade-married.html&title=David%20Spade%20Wants%20to%20Get%20Married%20%20Is%20He%20Husband%20Material%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-david-spade-married.html&description=David%20Spade%20Wants%20to%20Get%20Married%20%20Is%20He%20Husband%20Material%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./youssef-en-nesyri-wiki-who-are-his-parents-net-worth-and-salary-details.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Youssef En-Nesyri Wiki: Who Are His Parents?
