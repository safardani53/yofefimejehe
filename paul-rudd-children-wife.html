According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Cudi’s estimated net worth is around $16 million as of 2023.</p><p>However, many believe that the rapper’s net worth is much more than that since he has been involved in many ventures like music, acting, and the fashion industry. But since Cudi himself has not talked about his net worth and earnings, it is mere speculation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kid Cudi’s career in music</h2><p>Cudi’s discography includes eight studio albums, one compilation album, one box set, three extended plays (EPs), one mixtape, 32 singles, including 15 as a featured artist, eight promotional singles, and 32 music videos.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Cudi was born and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">raised</a> in Ohio, and his lyrics typically address his introspection, which he attributes to the perceived challenges of growing up as a somewhat detached striving musician.</p><p>Cudi began his musical career in 2003, leaving his birthplace of Cleveland to pursue a musical career in New York City.&nbsp;He released the song ‘Day ‘n’ Nite’ in November 2007, which received little attention on sites such as MySpace and numerous underground music blogs.</p><p>The next year, it piqued the interest of Plain Pat, the then-manager of high-profile rapper Kanye West, whom Cudi had met two years previously.&nbsp;In a joint venture with Universal Motown Records, West signed the singer to his label GOOD Music, and the company re-released ‘Day ‘n’ Nite’ as his first song.</p><p>Man on the Moon: The End of Day, Cudi’s debut album, was released in September 2009 to critical acclaim and financial success. The album was named one of Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, got RIAA quadruple platinum certification, three Grammy Award nominations, and is widely regarded as his hallmark work.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The album also featured the songs ‘Make Her Say’ with West and Common and ‘Pursuit of Happiness’ featuring MGMT and Ratatat, the latter of which received diamond or 10x platinum certification from the RIAA. Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager, Cudi’s second album, which was certified platinum, was released in 2010.</p><p>Later that year, he co-founded the rock band WZRD with long-time collaborator and producer Dot da Genius. Their self-titled debut album, WZRD, debuted at the top of the Billboard Top Rock Albums list in 2012.</p><p>Cudi’s third self-produced album, Indicud (2013), was certified gold by the RIAA and generated the platinum-selling single ‘Just What I Am.’ After leaving GOOD Music, he released the experimental and lukewarmly acclaimed avant-garde albums Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon (2014) and Speedin’ Bullet 2 Heaven (2015), the latter headed by the grunge-inspired track ‘Confused!’&nbsp;</p><p>Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin’ (2016), his sixth album, received positive reviews and was accompanied by the first song ‘Surfin’ with Pharrell Williams. Cudi later created the duo Kids See Ghosts with West in 2018, releasing their self-titled debut album to tremendous critical acclaim the same year.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Cudi achieved his first number-one record on the US Billboard Hot 100 list in April 2020 with the single ‘The Scotts’ featuring Travis Scott, predicting the release of his seventh album, Man on the Moon III: The Chosen (2020), to commercial revival and favorable praise.</p><p>Cudi released his eighth album, Entergalactic (2022), to coincide with his critically acclaimed adult animated special of the same name.</p><p>According to the Recording Industry Association of America (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RIAA</a>), Cudi has sold a total of 22 million albums in the United States as of June 2020. Among the many accolades he has won, he has received two Grammy Awards out of five nominations.&nbsp;</p><p>Cudi is widely regarded as a major <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">influence</a> on several modern hip-hop and alternative musicians. His songs are frequently personal, addressing childhood struggles with despair, loneliness, and alienation, as well as his mature fight with alcohol and drugs and themes of spirituality, grief, dissipation, and celebration.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The majority of his influence originates from his ability to show vulnerability and discuss mental health issues. He is also known for his experimental music, which incorporates elements of psychedelia, R&B, electronica, synthpop, dance, house, punk, and indie rock.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at his elaborate discography, it is no wonder that Cudi’s music career contributed to his net worth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kid Cudi’s acting career</h2><p>Cudi had a special <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">appearance</a> as himself on the American television show One Tree Hill in 2010, singing his Man on the Moon II track ‘Erase Me’ throughout the episode. He also began starring as part of the main cast in the HBO comedy series How to Make It in America in 2010, using his birth name Scott Mescudi, until the show was canceled after two seasons.&nbsp;</p><p>Cudi and fellow American rapper Cage starred as French-speaking serial killers in a short film directed by <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/relationship/mia-goth-dating-history/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Shia LaBeouf</a> on October 31, 2010. The short film, Maniac, was inspired by Cudi’s song of the same name from his 2010 album Man on the Moon II and is a tribute to the 1992 Belgian black comedy criminal mockumentary Man Bites Dog.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Cudi was cast in the independent romance comedy Two Night Stand, opposite Analeigh Tipton and Miles Teller, in October 2012.

On April 11, 2014, it was reported that Cudi would co-star in the film James White with Christopher Abbott and Cynthia Nixon.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to appearing in the film, it was confirmed that Cudi will also select the soundtrack.

Bang!. Cudi created original music for the program as the in-house disc jockey and performed in various sketches during season four.&nbsp;</p><p>The season finale and Cudi’s final episode as bandleader aired on Comedy Bang! Bang! on December 10, 2015.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Cudi joined the cast of FOX’s Empire in July 2016, making his debut in the third season as an independent musician who competes with Hakeem. However, owing to creative disagreements, he subsequently departed the project.&nbsp;</p><p>Cudi starred in the comedic film Killing Hasselhoff in 2017. He appeared in Drunk Parents in 2019. He also appeared in the sci-fi western and dystopian series Westworld that year.</p><p>In 2020, he co-starred in Dean Parisot’s Bill & Ted Face the Music alongside Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter. In 2020, Cudi co-starred in We Are Who We Are, an eight-episode HBO miniseries directed by Luca Guadagnino and starring Chlo Sevigny.&nbsp;</p><p>In January 2021, Cudi hinted that he could be collaborating with TV producer and fellow American rapper 50 Cent on an upcoming series. Cudi was an executive producer on the award-winning drama film Malcolm & Marie in 2021.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Cudi appeared in Crisis, directed by Nicholas Jarecki, in early 2021. He starred in the ensemble cast of Don’t Look Up in late 2021, where he also sang an original song for the film with fellow American artist Ariana Grande.&nbsp;</p><p>He featured in Ti West’s slasher thriller X, which was released to great acclaim in March 2022.

Later in March 2022, he announced that he would make his feature directing debut with the Netflix film Teddy, which he also wrote and will appear in.</p><p>He was cast in the John Woo-directed action-thriller Silent Night in April 2022 with Joel Kinnaman. Furthermore, as reported in 2019, Cudi will appear in his animated TV special, Entergalactic, on Netflix, which will serve as a companion piece to his eighth solo album of the same name, which was released on September 30, 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kid Cudi’s career in modeling and fashion</h2><p>BAPE, a Japanese apparel manufacturer, placed Cudi’s image on T-shirts in September 2009.
