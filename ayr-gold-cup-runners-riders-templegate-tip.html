Won this last year and in fantastic form again with a York win and unlucky run at The Curragh last time. Can go close again.</p><p>ROHAAN</p><p>HAAN-tastic. Group 2 winner at best and likes this trip with some cut. Not disgraced in hotter race at Haydock last time and has solid place claims.</p><p>FAST RESPONSE</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Horse Racing</h2></p><p>FAST and loose. Best form in the mud and solid Listed second at Chester last time. Claimer brings weight down and more rain would boost his chances.</p><p>NORTHERN EXPRESS</p><p>CROSS out Ex. Tries a sprint for the first time after running well over a mile at York latest. Likely to find this too sharp.</p><p>DESERT COP</p><p>COP off. Few miles on the clock but both wins came on the AW and he was poor at York last time. Plenty to find.</p><p>MONTASSIB</p><p>SUB Sib. Has shown best form over 7f including at Ascot last time. Things likely to happen too quickly for him here.</p><p>ORAZIO</p><p>ON the Raz. Kicked off the season with two good run on soft before fast ground caught him out in the Wokingham. Didn’t enjoy Goodwood last time but is better than that and can bounce back. Big player.</p><p>GWEEDORE</p><p>Dore bore. Has won here over a mile and he was poor dropped in trip at Donny last time. Mountain to climb.</p><p>ABERAMA GOLD</p><p>Usually runs well here and was a fair sixth in the Silver Cup last season. Has moved yards since and landed the Stewards’ Cup in the mud before two modest runs. Big place shout if finding his Goodwood form.</p><p>ESCOBAR</p><p>HIGH Bar. Eighth in this last year and hasn’t been firing this season over his usual longer trips. Likes it soft but hard to fancy.</p><p>GORAK</p><p>RAK off. Has shown his best form over further and has been well beaten on his past two starts at sprint level. Swerve.</p><p>ALBASHEER</p><p>SHEER thrill. Has few miles on the clock and was unlucky when only eighth at The Curragh last time. Both wins have come on quick ground which is a slight concern.</p><p>RAMAZAN</p><p>RAM raid. Has won two of past three but has clearly improved since stepping up to 7f. Can’t be ruled out but drop in trip not certain to suit.</p><p>BIELSA</p><p>BIEL deal. Won this in 2021 but flopped last year. Looked more his old self this season with a good third in the Stewards’ Cup last time. Can’t be ignored off just 1lb higher than his winning run.</p><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFERS OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>Tote: Bet £5 Get £20 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label="CLAIM HERE (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Virgin Bet: Bet £10 Get £20 in free bets - <a aria-label="CLAIM HERE (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Betfair</strong>:<strong> Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Paddy Power: Bet £20 and get it back as Cash if it Loses</strong> - <strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Sky Bet: <strong>Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Horse Racing Bets</strong> </strong>- <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p>Tote: New customers online only.

Third last year from a 6lb lower mark but looked better than ever when going close in a York Listed race last time. Very soft ground wouldn’t suit but he’s a major player otherwise.</p><p>LETHAL LEVI</p><p>LEV it out. Best form has come over this trip on fast ground but handled cut when fourth at Donny last time. Will have to improve on that.</p><p>MAGICAL SPIRIT</p><p>SPIRIT willing. Likes this trip on soft and is only 1lb higher than his last win.

Trip and soft ground suit so he could bounce back.</p><p>PAWS FOR THOUGHT</p><p>PAWS off. Won three times after a wind op and solid run at Chester last time. Needs more at this level.</p><p>SIGNIFICANTLY</p><p>SIG on fire. In flying form all season and was just pipped in the Portland at Donny last week after a good effort in the Stewards’ Cup. Likes some cut and will be thereabouts.</p><p>MONDAMMEJ</p><p>DAMMEJ limitation. On long losing run and should find this ground too quick.</p><p>LEQUINTO</p><p>TO bad.
