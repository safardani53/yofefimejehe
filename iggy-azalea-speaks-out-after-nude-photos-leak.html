I feel blindsided, embarrassed, violated, angry, sad and a million other things. Not solely because I did not consent to this — but also because of the vile way people have reacted,” she began.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Azalea went on to discuss the many comments, particularly from men, who were “sharing their thoughts and fantasies in regards to my body” and how they were incredibly disturbing and made her nauseous.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The outright wicked things people say is overwhelming & makes me feel like throwing up,” she wrote. “If you’ve ever been humiliated before in front of family & those you care about maybe you can relate to what I’m going through.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s like a nuclear bomb that explodes and not only destroys you emotionally, but leaves a path of destruction in your personal life, effecting [sic] your relationships & people who matter most too [sic].”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Noel Vasquez/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Opening up about the GQ outtakes, Azalea said she was inspired by the “high profile women” who had previously shot covers for the acclaimed magazine in a strategically-sexy manner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Recently some outtakes from my 2016 GQ magazine cover were leaked to the public,” she explained. “A lot of high profile women have shot covers for GQ with a strategically placed hand etc covering their breasts etc. I always felt they were very beautiful covers, so I jumped at the opportunity.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I hadn’t seen other women’s covers leak so I felt comfortable (on a closed set) to model for such a reputable magazine knowing only the images with my hands covering would be considered for print,” she continued. “I never consented to taking topless pictures for potential release, period. It was my understanding BEFORE shooting, GQ do not print topless pictures.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“There was no reason for anyone to have kept the outtakes from the shoot. I’m surprised and angry that they were not immediately deleted after the final images were selected,” Azalea added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reps at GQ did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Iggy Azalea/Twitter</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As she finished her note, Azalea said she plans on holding the person who leaked her photos “accountable for their actions” and requested that her followers “be kinder to one another,” though she would be taking an indefinite break from social media.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I fully intended on finding out where the leak originated from and pressing criminal charges in regards to this. It’s important to me that someone actually be held accountable for their actions & the way it impacts my life,” she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I don’t feel there is any where [sic] I can retreat to or that I have a ‘happy place’ I can wait in until it all blows over. Please think of how you might feel if the shoe was yours to wear,” she urged. “I have seen some really vicious s— written in the last 24 hours and it is too much negativity for me to handle. For now it’s best to keep my accounts deactivated.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Please be kinder to one another,” the singer added.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Iggy Azalea.</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nino Munoz, the photographer on Azalea’s shoot, also addressed the situation on Instagram. “I’m outraged and saddened to find out that images of mine were stolen and published without my permission,” he wrote. “There is currently an investigation underway. Posting these stolen images is illegal and anyone that has done so will be prosecuted.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added, “I [empathize] with any discomfort that this situation has caused to anyone that is involved.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Azalea hasn’t had the most positive social media experience as of late.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earlier this month, she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>landed herself in hot water</a> with fans after she spoiled a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Game of Thrones</a> episode in the final season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pop star posted an Instagram video meant to convey her excitement for episode four, which aired later that night and shared a fan-made meme that was based on a clip from the new music video for her song “Started.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Text above the footage read: “My reaction to Arya Stark killing the Night King,” a reference to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Maisie Williams</a>‘ character, who was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>the heroine from the epic Battle of Winterfell episode</a> that aired the week prior to Azalea’s post.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But she also made sure to include a final note in the caption, writing: ““P.S. If you aren’t ‘caught up’ ‘just started watchinggggg’ or ‘didnnnt have time to watch yet’ cry me a river cause I didn’t watch on the dot for damn near a decade to not be able to talk about the episodes cause your ass is late.
