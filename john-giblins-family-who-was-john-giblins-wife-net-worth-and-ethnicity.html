As a consequence, we don’t know if John was married or not. He was, nonetheless, quite close to Kate Bash. John had been a long-time part of Kate’s musical family and, eventually, her KT fellowship.&nbsp;John has a long history of working with Kate, starting with his contributions to the album Never For Ever’s tracks Babooshka and Breathing. Since then, he has been on the albums The Sensual World, The Red Shoes, Aerial, Director’s Cut, and 50 Words For Snow.</p><p>It was their first time working together when they collaborated on Peter Gabriel’s song No Self Control in 1979. Kate hired John as her bassist for her Before The Dawn performances in 2014. His encouragement of her efforts has been immense.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/John-Giblin-1.jpg alt="John Giblin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Ethnicity And Origin Of John Giblin’s Family</h2><p>John Giblin was born in Bellshill, Scotland, to a musical family. However, his parents’ identities are not disclosed publicly.&nbsp;Since his parents’ identities are unknown, we were unable to determine John’s ethnicity.&nbsp;Teenage musical fascination prompted him to perform in rock and pop ensembles. In his teenage years, John began performing with various rock and pop ensembles and quickly advanced. He ultimately became an accomplished bassist, renowned for his prodigious double bass and bass guitar skills.</p><p>Giblin’s career as a session musician flourished during the 1970s and 1980s, during which time he collaborated with some of music’s most renowned artists. John has performed alongside artists including Simple Minds, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, Elkie Brooks, Peter Gabriel, and John Martyn, to name a few.&nbsp;He was renowned for his versatility and ability to perform in numerous musical styles, including jazz, classical, rock, and avant-garde.</p><h2>How Much Money Does John Giblin Make As A Bassist?</h2><p>John Giblin has an estimated net worth of approximately $2 million, according to Net Worth Post.&nbsp;Robert M. Corich, a producer, referred to John as an “extraordinary bass guitarist, double bassist, arranger, and session musician in general.”&nbsp;Soon, he was touring and recording with artists such as Peter Gabriel, Kate Bush, Phil Collins, Eric Clapton, and Annie Lennox, to name a few.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/John-Giblin-2.jpg alt="John Giblin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>As a consequence, it is reasonable to assume that the bassist earned a substantial income from his collaborations with such prominent figures.&nbsp;He replaced Derek Forbes as bassist for Simple Minds, where he frequently played fretless bass, and played on three albums with them before returning to his previous career as a studio musician.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihqKCeYrSqrsuipaxllpa6qrjYZq6hp12srrR5yaifp2WXnq%2Bttc2sZLChlpp6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqK6w2acraCenrCqwNho</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjohn-giblins-family-who-was-john-giblins-wife-net-worth-and-ethnicity.html&text=John%20Giblins%20Family%3a%20Who%20Was%20John%20Giblins%20Wife%3f%20Net%20Worth%20And%20Ethnicity&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohn-giblins-family-who-was-john-giblins-wife-net-worth-and-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-giblins-family-who-was-john-giblins-wife-net-worth-and-ethnicity.html&title=John%20Giblins%20Family%3a%20Who%20Was%20John%20Giblins%20Wife%3f%20Net%20Worth%20And%20Ethnicity" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjohn-giblins-family-who-was-john-giblins-wife-net-worth-and-ethnicity.html&title=John%20Giblins%20Family%3a%20Who%20Was%20John%20Giblins%20Wife%3f%20Net%20Worth%20And%20Ethnicity" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-giblins-family-who-was-john-giblins-wife-net-worth-and-ethnicity.html&title=John%20Giblins%20Family%3a%20Who%20Was%20John%20Giblins%20Wife%3f%20Net%20Worth%20And%20Ethnicity" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohn-giblins-family-who-was-john-giblins-wife-net-worth-and-ethnicity.html&description=John%20Giblins%20Family%3a%20Who%20Was%20John%20Giblins%20Wife%3f%20Net%20Worth%20And%20Ethnicity" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ruby-lyn.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ruby Lyn">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./david-duchovnys-girlfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David Duchovnys Girlfriend: Who is David Duchovny Dating?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
