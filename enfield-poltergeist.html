She wasn't moving her lips but the voice would just appear, talking for hours.</p><p>"The voice would say a lot of childish stuff - swearing as well.&nbsp;It was very disturbing.</p><p>"Something strange was happening which just wasn't normal."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/rozmorrisjgk13666-007web.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000000450490.jpg><p>Things only got weirder when Janet started having violent trances and claims soon spread that the 11-year-old could levitate, supposedly hoisted into the air by a mischievous energy.</p><p>A famous photo of Janet "hovering" in the middle of her bedroom was soon published as evidence, taken remotely by a camera set up in Janet's room by snapper Graham Morris.</p><p>The spooked photographer said he knew something was up when he first opened the door to 284 Green Street to a barrage of marbles and Lego bricks, which he says were hurled by the same spirit which tormented Janet.</p><p>And now he had what many believed was photo evidence.</p><p>The snaps were stacked in a file bulging with over 2,000 separate reports of paranormal activity at the Enfield home, supplied by over 30 eyewitnesses to the unusual goings on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/213.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/115.png><h2>Interviewing a poltergeist</h2><p>The story of the Enfield Poltergeist has stuck with Roz ever since and she appeared this week on a BBC Radio 4 show, The Reunion, to look back on the case.</p><p>Photographer Graham appears on the show as well, having also experienced the strangeness of the whole saga firsthand.</p><p>He says: "I stood in the gloom in the kitchen and one by one they brought the children into the adults' arms and the last one to come in was Janet. Suddenly things just took off and started flying around the room.</p><p>"Everyone wanted to see it. They came in as sceptics and left believing they had seen something."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/56.png><p>In the following months, things got even more sinister.</p><p>Janet claimed that she was being "used" by the poltergeist, while the strange bangs and knocking sounds persisted.</p><p>And then came the interview.</p><p>Maurice Grosse, a former inventor and leading paranormal investigator, had based himself at the house and was joined in the investigation by poltergeist expert&nbsp;Guy&nbsp;<span class=il>Playfair, who sadly passed away at the weekend.&nbsp;</span></p><p>While they were at the home the researchers reported a series of "curious whistling and barking noises coming from Janet’s general direction" which were attributed to the mysterious spirit.</p><p>And so it was decided that the TV cameras should be fired up for a world first: a recorded interview with the poltergeist, where Grosse tried to pin down who could be behind the hauntings which were gripping the nation.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Investigator claims to interview Janet Hodgson on BBC documentary The Enfield Poltergeist</span><h2>Prank or paranormal?</h2><p>The investigator did his research, and tried to narrow down details about the ghost based on its responses to his questioning.</p><p>He eventually deduced that the spirit must belong to 72-year-old Bill Wilkins, a man who had lived and died at the house decades earlier.</p><p>Meanwhile, for Janet, being used as a conduit for a long-dead man seemed to be taking its toll.</p><p>Her trances became more violent, and her mother allegedly once had to intervene when, during one disturbing episode, Janet wrapped herself in a curtain - the fabric tangled around her throat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000245163123.jpg><p>The independent reports of strange goings on blew the story into a national sensation, and the Enfield Poltergeist has since been dramatised in TV series such as The Enfield Haunting and films like The Conjuring 2.</p><p>But many sceptics have insisted right from the beginning that, like the exaggerated Hollywood retellings of the story, the case of the Enfield Poltergeist is nothing more than fiction.</p><p>At the time, a theory emerged that mum Peggy was behind the whole thing as part of a ploy to get a better council house or in return for fame and money.</p><p>But she never made a penny from recounting the story to reporters, and she never moved out of the house - right up to her death in 2003.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Watch the official movie trailer for The Conjuring 2&nbsp;</span><p>The idea was also floated by sceptics that Janet might be a ventriloquist and could have been behind the "demonic" voices heard by reporters.</p><p>Others suggested that the most famous photo of Janet hovering above the ground in her bedroom showed nothing more sinister than a girl bouncing on her bed, triggering the motion camera which had been set up in her room.</p><p>The sceptics' case was reinforced when the girls admitted to pranking some investigators by hiding their tape players and making odd noises as they poked around the family home.</p><p>But Janet, now in her 50s, maintains that every other&nbsp;detail of the haunting - from the demonic voice to her sporadic levitation - was totally genuine.</p><p>And today the house where the hauntings took place is owned by another family, although it remains the site of intense speculation about what really happened 40 years ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000244899732.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in news</h2></p><p>Roz, now the managing director of<a href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;TV News London</a>, a media training company, says: "I was also sceptical at first and looking out for trickery.</p><p>"But there were lots of independent witnesses and it was the report of the policewoman which really stood the story up.</p><p>"I was a reporter for many years and it was the weirdest story I've ever reported on.</p><p>"There was definitely something unusual going on, but I honestly don't know what caused it."</p><p><strong>BBC Radio 4’s The Reunion: The Enfield Poltergeist is available to listen to <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>.&nbsp;A repeat will air on Radio 4 at 9am on Friday 13 April.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfa31zf5FwcGidnpu2prjDZqeopKSav6ixyKyraA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fenfield-poltergeist.html&text=I%20never%20believed%20in%20the%20Enfield%20Poltergeist...%20until%20I%20heard%20strange%20scraping%20on%20the%20floorboards%20and&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fenfield-poltergeist.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fenfield-poltergeist.html&title=I%20never%20believed%20in%20the%20Enfield%20Poltergeist...%20until%20I%20heard%20strange%20scraping%20on%20the%20floorboards%20and" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fenfield-poltergeist.html&title=I%20never%20believed%20in%20the%20Enfield%20Poltergeist...%20until%20I%20heard%20strange%20scraping%20on%20the%20floorboards%20and" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fenfield-poltergeist.html&title=I%20never%20believed%20in%20the%20Enfield%20Poltergeist...%20until%20I%20heard%20strange%20scraping%20on%20the%20floorboards%20and" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fenfield-poltergeist.html&description=I%20never%20believed%20in%20the%20Enfield%20Poltergeist...%20until%20I%20heard%20strange%20scraping%20on%20the%20floorboards%20and" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nigel-ah-wong.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nigel Ah Wong">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./emily-eddington.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emily Eddington">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
