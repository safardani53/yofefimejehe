And indeed the separation came as a bit of shock for most of the fans of the two. But, what happened has happened. And there's no going back!</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-909 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>So, who is Victoria dating currently?

Though after her breakup with Fode, she wasn't linked to any other name for a brief period of time, however, she later found love with "The Tempest" actor Reeve.</p><p>The couple started dating since <a href=#>December 2016</a>.&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Though Victoria and Reeve are still in a relationship, the &nbsp;star's love life doesn't seem to be a&nbsp;simple one. The actress made an inspirational post on July 21, on her Instagram account suggesting a decent way of life. Want to know what she has posted?</p><p>Victoria posted a picture of the late American actor&nbsp;<strong>James Dean</strong>,&nbsp;well known as an icon of teenage disillusionment with words written on it,<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>"Dream as if you'll live forever.

And after all of her past&nbsp;relationships, the best way to keep yourself happy and lively is by taking a gap form relationships, isn't it?</p><p>And prior to this on June 14, Victoria posted a picture of a portrait of an intimate couple which probably reflects her emotional mind's state.</p><p>Check out what she posted.</p><p><a href=#>Have you been hugged lately? "Did you know...the average length of a hug between two people is 3 seconds, but researchers have discovered something fantastic. When a hug lasts 20 seconds, there is a therapeutic effect on the body and mind. The reason is that a sincere hug produces a hormone called "oxytocin", also known as the love hormone. This substance has many benefits in our physical and mental health, helps us, among other things, to relax, to feel safe and calm our fears and anxiety. This wonderful calming is offered free of charge every time we have a person in our arms, when we cradled a child, cherish a dog or cat, we're dancing with our partner, the closer we get to someone or just hold the shoulders of a friend." Hug someone you love today, for your health;) ??</a></p><p>A post shared by Victoria Justice (@victoriajustice) on Jun 13, 2017 at 1:06pm PDT</p><p>After checking some of her Instagram posts, it can be said, Victoria probably misses a romantic relationship but wants a break to enjoy her singlehood.
