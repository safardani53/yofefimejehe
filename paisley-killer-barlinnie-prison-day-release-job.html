I don’t think it’s right. He shouldn’t be allowed back in public. It’s not even been 15 years since he killed my son.</p><p>“I knew it was coming but I didn’t know it was coming this early. What happened to my Scott never goes away.</p><p>"My son is with me every day.”</p><p>Price was 19 when he knifed Scott, 24, in a frenzied attack at his Paisley home in 2007.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>The brute’s girlfriend, Karen Duncan, then 17, also plunged a screwdriver into the helpless victim before using a mobile to take snaps of the bloodbath while sick Price posed next to his corpse.</p><p>The murderer and his lover even frolicked in a bath after the horror.</p><p>They later moved the body with the help of Duncan’s sister Irene in a bid to hide their crimes but cops nailed them amid overwhelming evidence.</p><p>We watched earlier this week as bald Price — dressed casually in a blue jeans and a fleece — left the golf course after his shift.</p><h3>OUT AND ABOUT</h3><p>We also spotted him wearing a blue jacket as he waited at a nearby bus stop next to unsuspecting members of the public.</p><p>Tonight the fiend’s family claimed he was remorseful over the murder — and that he was now on the road to rehabilitation. It’s understood he could be around two years away from being released.</p><p>If prison bosses are pleased with his progress, he could even be switched to an open jail before a decision is made.</p><p>A relative of Price said: “It was a horrible thing what happened.</p><p>“I really am sorry for the family. They’ve been through a lot. But when it happened, [Price] was a child.</p><h3>'HE'S CHANGED'</h3><p>“As far as I’m concerned, he had a lot of problems back then. He’s not [like] that now. He’s quite an educated person now — very mannerly and well spoken. He has changed his life.”</p><p>They added: “Stephen’s work placement is about integration.</p><p>“He is in the community to see how they can handle it and to progress hopefully from there.</p><p>“He’s going through a process and is on the last leg of that.</p><p>“He is a changed, changed boy — he has behaved very well to my knowledge.”</p><p>But tonight a source said: “The guy is a convicted killer currently doing a life sentence for a brutal murder.</p><p>“As far as I’m concerned he is putting workers and golfers at risk. No one knows about his past.</p><p>“He is out on the course all day, mostly unsupervised, so is definitely around golfers and people walking through the golf course.</p><p>“He is doing greenkeeping jobs like strimming, cutting grass — just general maintenance.”</p><p>Jailing Price for life in 2008, judge Lord Brady branded him “depraved”.</p><p>The High Court in Glasgow heard the fiend — who pled guilty to the murder — had later sent a letter of apology to his stepmum.</p><p>Tonight a Scottish Prison Service spokesman said: “We don’t comment on individual prisoners.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Cawder Golf Course was also asked for comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000696075704-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/prisoner-drop.png> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Shocking moment Addiewell prison inmate films himself snogging female officer in his jail cell</span><br><p><strong>We pay for your stories and videos!
