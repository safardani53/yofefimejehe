reports of significant damage" to homes in Stalybridge, Tameside, at around 11.45pm due to a "localised tornado".</p><p>Dramatic pictures show the scale of destruction including collapsed chimney

night and continue to be out today clearing debris, fallen trees and making roads, footpaths and other areas safe."</p><p>Chief Superintendent Mark Dexter from GMP said: "This incident has undoubtedly affected numerous people in the Stalybridge area with many residents displaced from their properties during the night.</p><p>"Our highest priority is keeping people safe which is why we are advising those who have been displaced not to return or enter their properties which have significant damage until they have been assessed by structural engineers.</p><p>"I would also like to urge members of the public to avoid the area where possible and take extra care when travelling in vehicles on the roads in Stalybridge and the surrounding areas, due to debris in the road."</p><h2

through the window" for about thirty seconds when the freak weather event hit.</p><p>He went into the street to pick up some debris after and noticed a gutter lying in the middle of the road, before he realised his neighbour's roof had been destroyed.</p><p>"I heard extreme noise at my back window," he said. "I was stood at my patio door and there was just basically a crazy sounding noise and then vibrations through the glass.</p><p><strong>Have YOU been affected by Storm Gerrit?&nbsp;Contact: jonathan.rose@thesun.co.uk OR call The Sun on 020 7782 4100</strong></p><p>"I looked out of the window and saw a bit of debris so I thought I'd go out and pick a few bits up.</p><p>"Then I saw a piece of tree next to my neighbour's car, then I looked further along the street and saw a gutter in the middle of the street so I thought I'd go and pick that up, and then I saw my neighbour had had half his house torn off."</p><p>He said the whole incident lasted "25 to 30 seconds".</p><p>"Two or three minutes later the entire estate was on the street, and we were just wondering what would happen next," he added.</p><p>He said he "saw the intensity of the rain" through his back door and "could feel the moisture of the rain through the glass".</p><p>"I wouldn't have had time to react even if I had wanted to - and then before anything had happened it was all over."</p><p>Another man, whose car was badly damaged in the incident, said it was "lucky nobody was killed".</p><p>Local resident Andy Turner said that the tornado lasted for about 15 seconds and was "pure carnage".</p><p>He said: "At 11.30pm last night, there was - all I can describe - is a hurricane came through. It lasted for about 15 seconds.</p><p>"Cars were parked outside the house. My wife's car is a write off, my car's took a bit of the brunt of the tree.</p><p>"It's just lucky that nobody was hurt.

across Hereford, York and Carlisle and 131 flood alerts.</p><p>Ferry operator DFDS said its sailings between Dover and France are delayed due to strong winds in the Channel.</p><p>Passengers are being advised to check in as normal and are being put onto the first available sailing.</p><p>Train operator Avanti West Coast said a tree falling on overhead wires between Rugby and Lichfield Trent Valley means some lines are blocked.</p><p>Journey times for services from London Euston towards the North West are being extended as trains are diverted via the Midlands.</p><p>Miles of cars were left trapped in <a href=#>snow</a> yesterday, with trains across the UK cancelled as chills of -6.2C were recorded in Braemar, <a href=#>Scotland</a>.</p><p>Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said workers had been dealing with wind speeds of 80mph in some coastal areas as they worked to reconnect customers.</p><p>High winds, along with heavy rain and snow, damaged electricity networks across Scotland as fallen trees, branches and other debris brought down <a href=#>power</a> lines.</p><p>A yellow warning for wind and snow remained in place until 6am in the Shetlands.</p><p>SSEN said power had been restored to 25,000 properties with a further 16,000 <a href=#>homes</a> entering Thursday without power.</p><p>An SSEN spokesman said: "The widespread extent of the damage, the ongoing adverse <a href=#>weather</a> conditions, and the challenges accessing faults due to fallen trees, flooding and road closures, together mean that full network restoration will take time.</p><p>"Some customers in rural areas may be off supply for up to 48 hours."</p><p>Scotland <a href=#>Police</a> confirmed the A9 has fully reopened in both directions and is "passable

may be hazardous and extra caution should be exercised by all road users."</p><p>The A90 northbound has also reopened after earlier closures, but southbound lanes at Lochlands, Forfar, remain off-limits with local diversions in place.</p><p>Scotland's rail network experienced widespread cancellations and delays with a train driver's cabin hit by a falling tree.</p><p>Aslef Scotland confirmed the driver was uninjured and Labour MSP Paul Sweeney said passengers were also unharmed.</p><p><a href=#>ScotRail</a> suspended multiple train services until further notice, impacting trains travelling while other lines saw their timetables shelved until "a full inspection can be carried out" on the railway network.</p><p>Train operator LNER, which runs services between <a

which they can claim back.</p><p>Avanti West Coast, which operates services on the West Coast Main Line, said its route to Scotland is impassable with all services to and from London terminating at Preston.</p><p>Those with pre-booked tickets for travel between Preston and either Edinburgh or <a href=#>Glasgow</a> can board trains on Thursday or Friday, the operator said.</p><p>Authorities in Greater Manchester were also called to weather incidents amid reports of a possible tornado in Dukinfield and Mossley on Wednesday.</p><p>Tameside Council opened a reception area at Dukinfield Town Hall to cater for any displaced residents.</p><p>The Tornado and Storm Research Organisation said a detailed site investigation would need to be undertaken before it can confirm the damage was caused by a rare British tornado.</p><p>Heathrow Airport cancelled 18 flights due to air traffic control restrictions, understood to be return routes from <a href=#>Aberdeen</a>, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Jersey
