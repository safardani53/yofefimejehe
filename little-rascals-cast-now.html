The 1994 version of the film is a remake of the original TV shorts that came out in the 1950s. Since the film is still popular today, many fans wonder where their faves are now and where their careers took them.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>For some of the stars, their roles were the start of a big acting career but that's not the same for everyone.

Brandon "Bug" Hall is one of them. He played Alfalfa and went on to have a great acting career to this day. He was in well-known movies like Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves and Get a Clue. But he's also been in shows like CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and <a href=#>Criminal Minds</a>.
