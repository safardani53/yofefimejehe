We finally have the due date," Christine concluded.</p><h2>Is Christine in medical debt?</h2><p>Fans believe Christine is going through a financial rough patch, as she has previously <a href=#>asked her fans to purchase clothes </a>from her LuLaRoe clothing.</p><p>She said in the clip: “What you guys are doing by helping me so much with my purchases is you are helping me get something done.</p><p>“One of my daughter’s needs a surgery. I need $50,000 for a down payment for the surgery. You guys are helping me make it happen. Thank you. $50,000 for a down was so daunting so I decided to just work hard.”</p><p>She continued: “We’re halfway there! I can't thank you enough for all your purchases and you helping my family.</p><p>“I don’t know how we would be able to get the surgery she needs without LuLaRoe. I really appreciate it a lot, thank you!”</p><p>While Christine did not clarify which daughter needed surgery, fans believe it to be Ysabel, who suffers from scoliosis.</p><p>In May of 2020, Ysabel confirmed <a href=#>her scoliosis will be filmed for the upcoming season</a> of Sister Wives.</p><p>When a fan asked if she underwent spinal surgery, Ysabel responded: “No ma’am but to get updates make sure you watch our show:)))”</p><p>Christine has also been charging $35 for <a href=#>fan video requests on Cameo</a> in an effort to make ends meet.</p><h2>When is Sister Wives back on?</h2><p><a href=#>The 16th season</a> of Sister Wives premiered on November 21, 2021.</p><p>Despite publicly <a href=#>addressing her relationship</a>, Christine returned for season 16 of Sister Wives and in the first episode said she didn't want to make any "drastic decisions" about her marriage.</p><p>Christine's <a href=#>sister-wife, Meri</a>, told her she shouldn't give up so quickly on her marriage to Kody.</p><p>"You didn't put 30 years into this — 25, 28, wherever you are — to walk away," Meri told Christine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000602547699.png><h2>Are Christine Brown and Kody Brown together?</h2><p>During the Sister Wives season 15 finale, fans witnessed&nbsp;<a href=#>Christine Brown</a> reach <a href=#>her breaking point</a>&nbsp;with the family when she announced&nbsp;<a href=#>she was moving back to Utah</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>After breaking down in tears, she&nbsp;admitted to her fellow sister wife&nbsp;<a href=#>Meri Brown</a>, “I can’t do marriage with Kody anymore,” later adding, “I don’t want to. … It’s not enough.”</p><p>In November of 2021, after much speculation, Christine finally revealed she left Kody following&nbsp;<a href=#>several tense months</a>.</p><p>She has been open with fans <a href=#>following the split</a>, admitting&nbsp;<a href=#>she has "good and bad" days</a>.</p><p>She noted, however, that she feels "like a much better person" after calling it quits.</p><p>Christine&nbsp;<a href=#>sold her home in Arizona</a>, moving into a $1.1M Utah duplex near her daughter.</p><p>Christine said she was living in a "whole new world" and hoped she could remain "friends" with her ex for the sake of their youngest child together, Truely, 11.</p><p>She continued: "Because we've been still real high communicating with each other and stuff.
