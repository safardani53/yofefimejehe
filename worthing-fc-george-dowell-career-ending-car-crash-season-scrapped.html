This hurts, it hurts a lot.”</p><p>By his own estimations, he has poured “close to a million” into Worthing, a figure he looks surprised by himself when he tots it up before laughing off as “pretty mental” during a chat in the boardroom.</p><p>“Pretty mental” is possibly the best way to describe the turnaround since George took over, too.</p><p>No longer the stale “old boys’ club” where a few hundred fans would gather under a decrepit stand “while pigeons s**t in your tea”, Worthing are on the up, whatever the FA decides to do this season.</p><p>Crowds of more than 1,600 often pile into the newly-named Crucial Environmental Stadium to watch a young and largely local side fight for what would be their second promotion in four years during the Dowell revolution.</p><p>And those crowds – the fifth largest in the country for this level of football - now pack into the renovated bar from midday to long into Saturday night on matchdays, helping boost the club’s coffers.</p><p>As the adults have a drink, often with George alongside them, their kids play outside on the 3G pitch, hoping to one day play for the newly-formed academy sides and quite possibly the first team.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">LATEST FOOTBALL FEATURES</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000574580298.jpg><p lang=en dir=ltr>Imagine pouring your heart, soul, effort, time & money into something for 5 years.. and just when you’re on the brink of achieving what you, & everyone else, have been working so hard for, it’s ripped from beneath your feet.</p><p>This hurts, it hurts a lot. 💔😢<a href=#>#WeAreWorthing</a> 🐟🔴 <a href=#>https://t.co/25NDPCFx9M</a></p>— ցeorge ժowell MBE (@GeorgeDowell) <a href=#>March 26, 2020</a><p>It is the dream of helping local lads make it into the senior side and beyond, while creating a true community club, that has driven George on since his first day in charge.</p><p>He had just made the breakthrough into the first team himself and was awaiting England youth trials when a friend’s car carrying him and three pals flipped off the road and landed in a field on the way to get a McDonald’s in April 2010.</p><p>George woke in hospital and fears that it might be “pretty serious” when he couldn’t feel anything escalated when he was almost immediately transferred to Salisbury Spinal Unit 75 miles away.</p><p>“My family were told bang straightaway the night it happened that I’d broken my neck and won’t walk again,” he explains with an ease that hasn't come easily.</p><p>“I was asleep on heavy meds for most of the next two weeks but as soon as I was in a position to understand the consultant explained.</p><p>“It was hard, it was horrible. The first thing I thought was, ‘I won’t be playing football again’.</p><p>“That’s all I was doing at the time and all I wanted to do. When you’re told that it’s, ‘Where do you go from here?’.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/msemail_200226_JCPA_WorthingFC-1jpg-JS572158348.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/msemail_200226_JCPA_WorthingFC-38jpg-JS572158667.jpg><p>The next ten months were spent in Salisbury, the first three of those laid out flat.</p><p>But instead of wallowing, inspirational visits from former patients made George realise “there is a life after a spinal cord injury”.</p><p>His destiny, however, as owner of his old football club was unimaginable at the time.</p><p>“Football was still my passion but I struggled to watch it even on TV for a while because I knew I couldn’t play it,” reveals the former full-back, who was studying public services and thinking of being a firefighter before the crash.</p><p>“Then I found a different appreciation of watching it, like the tactical side and stuff. I started playing a lot of Football Manager in hospital.</p><p>“Then my mates said I should start my own team when I leave Salisbury.</p><p>“It took about two years because when I left hospital I wasn’t feeling confident and didn’t want to be around new people.</p><p>“I felt safe in the spinal unit. Then when I got home I felt comfortable so didn’t want to start going to places I hadn’t been before. I worried what people would think about being in a wheelchair.”</p><p>My family knew I couldn't sit at home twiddling my thumbs for the rest of my life</p><p>George eventually formed Worthing Borough FC and after two years rising from the bottom of the local park leagues while struggling for places to train, he decided to invest some of his compensation in building a community 3G facility.</p><p>At the same time a friend’s dad, Calvin Buckland, who was Worthing U18s assistant manager, told him that his old club was struggling.</p><p>While Worthing’s situation was dire, George admits that from his point of view, the “timing was perfect”.</p><p>Calvin offered to speak to the Worthing board about George investing in an artificial pitch at their increasingly rundown stadium.</p><p>But before any contact had even been made, it emerged that the club weren’t just struggling, they were weeks from going out of business.</p><p>“It was scary,” he admits. “I spoke to my mate’s dad again and said I’ll speak to the board about my idea.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/msemail_200226_JCPA_WorthingFC-34jpg-JS572158600.jpg><p>But rather than just hand over his cash, George had decided he wanted full control.</p><p>Despite some reluctance from the hierarchy and a preference to just have him as an investor rather than owner and chairman, they eventually released a wave of new shares which he bought, giving him 70 per cent of the club.</p><p>But the board weren’t the only ones who needed convincing.</p><p>On telling his mum about his plan to buy Worthing, George recalls: “She said, ‘You’re f***ing joking aren’t you?’.</p><p>“But then they were all fully supportive and understood that I couldn’t just sit at home twiddling my thumbs for the rest of my life. I wanted to get back involved in football and this was a brilliant opportunity.”</p><p>It was an opportunity George grabbed with both hands – even if it’s one he admits he “stumbled into and has somehow stumbled through”.</p><p>Straight out went the old board and in came a new pitch - a decision that has been pivotal in turning a debt-ridden club where players were being asked to play for free into one that is now approaching sustainability.</p><p>I don't know how we got through it, we were just winging it</p><p>“In the board’s ideal world I'd have put the pitch in and kept them all in place but my opinion at the time was the club was in debt for a reason,” George says.</p><p>“Not that any of them had done a bad job, I just think it needed a new lease of life and if I’m investing that amount of money I wanted to bring in people that I knew and trusted.</p><p>“We had a really strong group of volunteers and a financial director who stayed on but at the start it was just me, Calvin and that was about it.</p><p>“I’ve got a PA Jamie who’s one of my carers, he was down here a lot. It was just the three of us really and I don’t know how we got through it. We were just winging it really.</p><p>“The 3G pitch helped massively as it enables the rest of the community to use it.</p><p>“The older generation were against it and were like ’this doesn’t compare to grass’, but they all now appreciate that it’s the way forward for clubs at this level if they want to survive.</p><p>“You have to rely on the community to fund the club. Them and sponsors pay the wages.”</p><p>Progress off the pitch - including renovation of the main stand, turning the “dingy old bar” into a seven-day-a-week pub and building an outside bar - went hand in hand with success on it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/msemail_200226_JCPA_WorthingFC-45jpg-JS572160064.jpg><p>Within a year the club were promoted to the Isthmian Premier and after a period of developing the squad under current manager and former Brighton defender Adam Hinshelwood, 36, they find themselves on the verge of their highest standing in the English football pyramid in their 134-year history.</p><p>George is rightly proud that in that time the development of the academy teams has meant more than 40 youth players have made first-team appearances.</p><p>It has fulfilled his dream of creating a community club that gives kids a chance, <strong>“</strong>rather than bringing in 11 journeymen from London on massive money”.</p><p>The quality of youngsters in the squad is underlined by 18-year-old keeper Carl Rushworth, who is on loan from Brighton and has reportedly been <a href=#>scouted by Barcelona ahead of a £4million bid for the England U19 prospect.</a></p><p>As the club has grown George has stepped down as chairman and brought people in to fill new roles including club secretary, operations director and facilities manager.</p><p>Such is the stability at Worthing now, he jokes that “by the time I’m 60 or 70 I can start to have a repayment plan”.</p><p>When asked what the biggest challenge has been, George replies without hesitation.</p><p>“When you first come in you think nothing happens in the week.</p><p>“But there’s so much stuff that happens in the background – liaising with the league, health and safety, floodlight bulbs going, toilets blocked, stupid things like that.</p><p>“Then people just turn up and go ‘F***ing hell that’s broken’, and you think, ‘You don’t even understand what else we’ve been dealing with this week’.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000574580297.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000574580299.jpg><p>Worthing’s rise following George’s investment draws inevitable comparisons with Billericay, who romped into the National South after <a href=#>multi-millionaire Glenn Tamplin threw more than £2million at them.</a></p><p>The businessman brought in former Premier League stars Jermaine Pennant, Paul Konchesky and Jamie O’Hara on astronomical wages for this level of football and had a mural of himself in Messiah-like poses plastered along the side of their Essex stadium.</p><p>But George insists any comparisons are off the mark.</p><p>“We don’t want to be that like, where they piled money in,” he states.</p><p>“We played them when they were in our league and it’s really good down there but I won’t be getting a mural done here.</p><p>“Everyone was taking the mick saying you should get one done, but no chance.</p><p>“Everyone says a lot about Glenn and the way he went about it but he&nbsp;brings attention to the club, whether it’s good or bad, and put his money where his mouth is. Look where Billericay are as a result of it, fair play to him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3058400400000578-3406651-George_Dowell_went_on_a_date_with_18_year_old_English_student_Na-a-11_14532.jpg><p>George isn’t afraid to do whatever it takes to bring attention to Worthing, either.</p><p>In 2017 he agreed to appear on Channel 4 show The Undateables through a friend he met in the spinal unit, but with the main aim of boosting the club’s profile.</p><p>“If I’m brutally honest I did tell the producers at the start,” he confesses.</p><p>“I said I didn’t have that much intention of finding love because I’d just come out of a long-term relationship with the person I was with before my injury.</p><p>“In terms of publicity for this place it did help. A lot more people in Worthing will know about the club because of that show. But it did also help bring me out of my shell, so it worked two-fold.”</p><p>This year was the perfect storm and you never what will happen next in football</p><p>George, whose girlfriend-of-seven-months Jessica first got in touch with him on Facebook after seeing him on the show, perhaps wishes Worthing and its current plight were not in the spotlight right now.</p><p>“I’m absolutely gutted by the decision," he reveals. "I appreciate the seriousness of the situation we're facing at the moment, health and safety must come first.</p><p>“I just can't understand why if the higher tiers of football have been given the time to make their decision, why we couldn't have been awarded the same time?</p><p>“No one knows how this is going to play out, so making a decision now seems very hasty, and rash. Any outcome would be a lot easier for all clubs to swallow if it's the same rule throughout football. This needs to come from the top down.”</p><p>Facing up to the possibility that the FA rubber stamps the decision, George adds: "Fingers crossed everyone stays together here next season. We have a great club that does things properly with a great set-up and a brilliant coach.</p><p>“But this year was a perfect storm and everything went amazingly, and in football you just never know what can happen next.”</p><p>One thing is for sure though that whatever happens, those Worthing fans, and their chants about George, will be back next season.</p><p>“I don’t like a fuss but it is nice to know it’s appreciated,” George admits.</p><p>"The songs they come up with are amazing. We are so blessed to have our fanbase.”</p><p>And no doubt they feel just as blessed to have you too, George.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000574580284.jpg><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">CORONAVIRUS CRISIS - BE IN THE KNOW</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Get the latest coronavirus news, facts and figures from around the world - plus essential advice for you and your family.</p><p>To receive our Covid-19 newsletter in your inbox every tea time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-mce-href="http://link.thesun.co.uk/join/5pl/signup?source=covid19_box">sign up here</a>.</p><p>To follow us on Facebook, simply <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-mce-href=https://www.facebook.com/CoronavirusLatestTheSun/>'Like' our Coronavirus page</a>.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Simon Jordan blasts Premier League clubs for putting non-playing staff on furlough and says footballers must take a pay cut</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH5yf49uaW5wX6y8s8DHoqWgZZaYeqixzquenmWUpMSmuMtmmpqqlZq%2FbrHNnaCnn12YrrN5wquYrKBdqLKiv86nZKybopa9sbHDaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fworthing-fc-george-dowell-career-ending-car-crash-season-scrapped.html&text=Worthing%20FCs%20George%20Dowell%20fought%20back%20from%20a%20career-ending%20car%20crash%20to%20save%20his%20club%2c%20but%20the%20f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fworthing-fc-george-dowell-career-ending-car-crash-season-scrapped.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fworthing-fc-george-dowell-career-ending-car-crash-season-scrapped.html&title=Worthing%20FCs%20George%20Dowell%20fought%20back%20from%20a%20career-ending%20car%20crash%20to%20save%20his%20club%2c%20but%20the%20f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fworthing-fc-george-dowell-career-ending-car-crash-season-scrapped.html&title=Worthing%20FCs%20George%20Dowell%20fought%20back%20from%20a%20career-ending%20car%20crash%20to%20save%20his%20club%2c%20but%20the%20f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fworthing-fc-george-dowell-career-ending-car-crash-season-scrapped.html&title=Worthing%20FCs%20George%20Dowell%20fought%20back%20from%20a%20career-ending%20car%20crash%20to%20save%20his%20club%2c%20but%20the%20f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fworthing-fc-george-dowell-career-ending-car-crash-season-scrapped.html&description=Worthing%20FCs%20George%20Dowell%20fought%20back%20from%20a%20career-ending%20car%20crash%20to%20save%20his%20club%2c%20but%20the%20f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kelsea-ballerinis-acms-2021-makeup-breakdown.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="ACM Awards 2021: Kelsea Ballerinis Makeup Breakdown">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nrpzkymoccepaa63gvp9xlbhatbacgoi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch Danny Phantom Season 3 Episode 3: Girls' Night Out">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
