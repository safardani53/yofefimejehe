Her sons, Mark and Donnie, both have successful careers in Hollywood, but Alma achieved some level of fame on her own after appearing in <a href=#>Wahlburgers</a>, a reality series that followed the family as they attempted to run a restaurant.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mark and Donnie both paid tribute to their mother on social media.</h2><p>After news of her death broke, both Mark and Donnie took to social media to pay tribute to her life. "My Angel. Rest in peace," &nbsp;Mark wrote in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">caption of a photo</a> of Alma on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;"My mom Alma's joy for life, love and people -- combined with a pride in her humble beginnings and refusal to forget where she came from -- undoubtedly shaped me into the man that I am," Donnie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">added on his own post</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I've often said, if you like anything about me, I got it from Alma," he continued. "I say that because it's true. She was, without a doubt, the most loving human being I've ever known. I never heard her say, or do, anything disrespectful to anyone. She was, as anybody who ever came across her knows, true blue. Like so many moms who struggled, overcame odds, made something from nothing and pulled off the impossible for their children, she never complained."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who was Alma's friend Phyllis?</h2><p>Although Alma's tributes from her sons were a moving reminder of the family legacy she's left behind, there were also some longtime <a href=#>Walhburgers</a> fans who wanted to know how Alma's good friend Phyllis was dealing with the news.&nbsp;</p><p>Phyllis Cosgrove was not a member of the Wahlberg family, but she was the next best thing, and frequently appeared on Wahlburgers as one of Alma's best buds.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although she made somewhat regular appearance on the show, Phyllis was not a public figure the way Alma or her children were. As a result, there's not much publicly available information on Phyllis or what she's been up to more recently. At one point, she did <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have a Twitter account</a>, although it seems like it hasn't been active in nearly four years. When she was posting, Phyllis frequently wrote about Alma or her experience on the show.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Thanks to all of you who have tweeted," she wrote in one 2016 tweet. "It is so much fun doing the show. &nbsp;Love the family and crew. &nbsp;All genuine people."&nbsp;</p><p>During <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one memorable appearance</a> on the series, Alma and Phyllis caused a mess in the restaurant kitchen as they attempted to do a little baking.&nbsp;</p><p>Sequences like this suggested the warm relationship that existed between Alma and Phyllis, and also speaks to how lively Alma remained through the final years of her life. As her children suggested in their tributes, Alma seems to have been a warm and kind person, and she was never more charming than when she was getting into a little trouble with Phyllis.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmurYywmKGkkpq%2FqHnFq6CeppRivanFy6WgrA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2falma-wahlberg-friend-phyllis.html&text=Who%20Is%20Alma%20Wahlberg%27s%20Friend%20Phyllis%3f%20Inside%20Their%20Long%20Relationship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falma-wahlberg-friend-phyllis.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2falma-wahlberg-friend-phyllis.html&title=Who%20Is%20Alma%20Wahlberg%27s%20Friend%20Phyllis%3f%20Inside%20Their%20Long%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2falma-wahlberg-friend-phyllis.html&title=Who%20Is%20Alma%20Wahlberg%27s%20Friend%20Phyllis%3f%20Inside%20Their%20Long%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2falma-wahlberg-friend-phyllis.html&title=Who%20Is%20Alma%20Wahlberg%27s%20Friend%20Phyllis%3f%20Inside%20Their%20Long%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falma-wahlberg-friend-phyllis.html&description=Who%20Is%20Alma%20Wahlberg%27s%20Friend%20Phyllis%3f%20Inside%20Their%20Long%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-jordan-ward-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Jordan Ward Dating Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jennifer-lawrence-no-makeup-brown-hair-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="No Makeup!
